<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>Do I even need to explain why this is number 1? Best. Movie. Ever.</p>

<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>You can never go wrong with a rags to riches love story. Plus, Julia Roberts & Richard Gere are fabulous!</p>

<h3>A Star is Born</h3>
<p>First off, this is the Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper version. It's such a beautiful love story.</p>
