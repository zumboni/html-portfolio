<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Warren, PA on January 27, 1980. I moved to South Carolina in 1994 and have been in the state ever since. I attended Hillcrest
  High school in Simpsonville, SC. In 2002 I graduated from the University of South Carolina where I studied biology and medical humanities.
  After graduation I began working in the financial industry as a data entry clerk. I worked by way up to a data analyst over the course of
  nearly 13 years. After leaving this position I took nearly a year off and changed course entirely. I started over as a front desk specialist at
  Bon Secours Hospital. I then moved on to Piedmont Comprehensive Pain Management where I was the referral coordinator. Finally I transitioned back
  into the finance world (sort of) as a Revenue Cycle Management Generalist at New Horizon Famioy Health Services. In the summer of 2019, I quit
  work to care for my husband who is a disabled veteran.

<p>Over the course of the next few years (and throughout the pandemic), I tried to busy myself with my hobbies like reading or crafts but it just
  wasn't enough to keep my mind busy. In the summer of 2023, I started an ill-fated attempt to learn 3D modeling and Blender. It just was not for me.
  My husband kept mentioning web design but I just wasn't sure. Finally I decided to try it and found a course online through Udemy. I started it and 
  realized this might just be for me. The material was working my analytical brain but also stimulating my creative side. So here I am...
</p>

<p>It might surprise you to learn that my ultimate goal is not to start a new career with this new knowledge. I'm hoping I'll be able to do some side 
  projects or freelance work in the future with my new skills. Time will tell. For now I'll keep on learning and enjoying the journey.
